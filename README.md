# Cal Bot - A fully customizable Discord bot
#### *Music, admin, trivia, fun commands and much more!*

Cal Bot is optimized for efficient 24/7 use on multiple Discord servers. Currently the official Cal Bot is happily running on a [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) 24/7! As soon as multiple voice channels are supported by discord.py The official Cal Bot can grace your server! In the meantime you can host your own Cal Bot with full functionality on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is fully modular and comes with sets of features/commands that can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it customizable exactly how you want.  
You can turn Cal Bot into a trivia bot, an admin bot, a music bot (...) or all of these at the same time!  

The default set of Cal Bot's modules include but are not limited to: 
* Admin commands 
* Trivia (lists included and you can make new ones!)
* Music features (playlists, youtube, soundcloud, queues...)
* Stream alerts (twitch/hitbox)
* Clot machines (yes, really!)
* Custom commands
* Imgur/gif search
* And much much more

Cal Bot is in continuous development and new features get added all the time.

Have fun!
